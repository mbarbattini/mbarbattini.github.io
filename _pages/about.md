I am currently an R&D Engineer 2 at Honeywell with around 3 years of experience.

My work mainly consists of modeling electromagnetic interference and compatability (EMI/EMC) as it relates to cryogenic systems.

I enjoy learning about quantum mechanics both in and outside of work. I have experience simulating quantum systems using frameworks such as QuTiP and QuantumOptics.jl.

My research interests include circuit quantum electrodynamics, quantum-limited amplifiers, and the readout of RF signals at milli-Kelvin temperatures.
