I am currently an R&D Engineer 2 at Honeywell. My work mainly consists of electromagnetic interference and compatability (EMI/EMC) simulations as it relates to cryogenic systems. I enjoy learning about quantum mechanics both in and outside of work. I have experience simulating quantum systems using frameworks such as QuTiP and QuantumOptics.jl. My research interests include circuit quantum electrodynamics, quantum-limited amplifiers, and SQUID electronics.
